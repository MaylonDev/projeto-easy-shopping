## :dart: About the project

A simple page where I deepened my knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

I was able to learn and practice how and what type of position should be used on each occasion, thus, I gained a better view of how to use it correctly and explored my learnings about semantic HTML and pseudo classes.

I also put my knowledge of responsiveness into practice. At first I found it difficult to organize the page, but I managed to complete it and develop my knowledge.
